    "You can customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot using various options and methods provided by the Bokeh library. Here are some common ways to customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot:\n",

    "Title: You can add a title to a Bokeh plot using the title attribute of the Figure object. For example, to set the title of a \n",
    "plot to \"My Bokeh Plot\", \n",
    "you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "p.title.text = \"My Bokeh Plot\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Axes: You can customize the appearance of the axes of a Bokeh plot using the xaxis and yaxis attributes of the Figure object. For example, to set the label of the x-axis to \"X-axis label\" and the label of the y-axis to \"Y-axis label\", you can use the following code:\n",

    "\n",
    "p.xaxis.axis_label = \"X-axis label\"\n",
    "p.yaxis.axis_label = \"Y-axis label\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also customize other properties of the axes, such as their tick labels, font size, and axis range.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Legend: You can add a legend to a Bokeh plot using the legend attribute of the Figure object. For example, to add a legend to a plot with two glyphs, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "p.circle(x1, y1, legend_label=\"Circle\")\n",
    "p.line(x2, y2, legend_label=\"Line\")\n",
    "p.legend.location = \"top_left\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This will add a legend to the top-left corner of the plot, with labels \"Circle\" and \"Line\" corresponding to the two glyphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colors and styles: You can customize the colors, styles, and other visual properties of the glyphs in a Bokeh plot using various attributes of the glyph objects. For example, to change the color of a circle glyph to red and its size to 10, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "p.circle(x, y, size=10, color=\"red\")\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the many ways you can customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot. Bokeh provides a wide range of options and methods to tailor your plots to your specific needs and preferences."
